# React Learning Progress - From Scratch

Welcome to my **React Learning Progress** repository! This repository contains all the projects and progress I‚Äôve made while learning React, starting from the basics and gradually moving to more advanced topics.

Each project in this repo is designed to help me understand a specific concept in React. As I continue to learn and build, I add more projects to reflect my growing knowledge and skills.

## ‚ú® **Introduction**

This repository is dedicated to documenting my journey with React.js. React is an amazing JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and through these projects, I‚Äôve learned how to create dynamic, responsive web applications. I‚Äôve started from basic components and progressed to more advanced topics like hooks, routing, and state management.

Each project reflects a specific concept I‚Äôve learned, and serves as a showcase of my growing understanding of React.

## üìö **Learning Progress**

### Project 1: **Basic React Setup**
- **Objective**: Understand the basic structure of a React app.
- **Description**: Set up my first React application using Create React App. Learned how to structure the app, and basic JSX syntax.
- **Key Concepts**: React components, JSX, rendering, and basic project setup.

### Project 2: **Component Basics**
- **Objective**: Learn how to create and manage React components.
- **Description**: Created reusable components, understanding the difference between functional and class components.
- **Key Concepts**: Functional components, props, rendering components, component reusability.

### Project 3: **State and Props**
- **Objective**: Learn how to use state and props to manage dynamic data.
- **Description**: Built a dynamic list app where users can add and delete items using state and props.
- **Key Concepts**: `useState` hook, managing state, passing data via props, handling events.

### Project 4: **React Hooks**
- **Objective**: Master React hooks to manage state and lifecycle.
- **Description**: Created a counter app using the `useState` and `useEffect` hooks, learning about state management and side effects in functional components.
- **Key Concepts**: `useState`, `useEffect`, managing side effects, hooks in functional components.

### Project 5: **React Router**
- **Objective**: Implement routing and navigation within a React app.
- **Description**: Created a multi-page app with navigation using React Router. Learned how to handle dynamic routing and navigate between different pages.
- **Key Concepts**: React Router, `Link`, `Route`, `Switch`, and dynamic routing.

### Project 6: **State Management with Context API**
- **Objective**: Use Context API for global state management.
- **Description**: Built a shopping cart app where items can be added/removed using Context API for shared state management.
- **Key Concepts**: Context API, `useContext`, global state, prop drilling.

### Project 7: **API Integration**
- **Objective**: Learn how to fetch data from external APIs and display it in a React app.
- **Description**: Created a weather app that fetches data from a weather API and displays it dynamically.
- **Key Concepts**: `fetch` API, asynchronous operations, handling promises, displaying API data.

## üõ† **Technologies Used**

- React.js
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- HTML & CSS
- React Router
- Context API
- Axios (for API requests)
- Node.js (for backend in some projects)

## üéØ **Goals & Future Plans**

- **Complete Advanced React Topics**: Continue learning and implementing more advanced React topics such as:
  - React performance optimization
  - Server-side rendering with Next.js
  - React Native for mobile development
  - Advanced state management with Redux
- **Build Full-Stack Apps**: Start integrating React with backend technologies like Node.js or Express to build full-stack applications.
- **Contribute to Open Source**: As I become more proficient, contribute to open-source React projects to further my learning.
