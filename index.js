//react starting.....
/*
     blundlers - combines multiple js file into a single manageable file like vite ,parcel etc...
    
     to create a react app:-
     1> npm (node package manager) - allows us to install library
     2> npx (node package executor) - when we dont want to install but directly execute the file

     npx create-react-app <name of app> - takes time...
     alternative is vite and parcel etc....

     scripts - project ko chalane ke liye ya production ke liye ready krna 
     build - generates html css and js for browser
     eject - allows us to eject our app from react 

     start script - to run our react project in development env.
     // npm run start <enter>
